<h3>Introduction</h3>

This scratch course on stochastic processes covers significantly more material than usually found in traditional books or classes. The approach is original:  I introduce a new yet intuitive type of random structure called perturbed lattice or Poisson-binomial process, as the gateway to all the stochastic processes. Such models have started to gain considerable momentum recently, especially in sensor data, cellular networks, chemistry, physics and engineering applications. I present state-of-the-art material in simple words, in a compact style, including new research developments and open problems. I focus on the methodology and principles, providing the reader with solid foundations and numerous resources: theory, applications, illustrations, statistical inference, references, glossary, educational spreadsheet, source code, stochastic simulations, original exercises, videos and more.

The textbook (96 pages) is published by <a href="http://www.datashaping.com">Data Shaping Solutions, LLC</a>. It is currently available on <a href="https://bit.ly/3vr6ka5">Lulu</a>.
